      <description>&lt;p&gt;The positive uses of AI for cyber security
Biometric logins are increasingly being used to create secure logins by either scanning fingerprints, retinas, or palm prints. This can be used alone or in conjunction with a password and is already being used in most new smartphones. Large companies have been the victims of security breaches which compromised email addresses, personal information, and passwords. Cyber security experts have reiterated on multiple occasions that passwords are extremely vulnerable to cuber attacks, compromising personal information, credit card information, and social security numbers. These are all reasons why biometric logins are a positive AI contribution to cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can also be used to detect threats and other potentially malicious activities. Conventional systems simply cannot keep up with the sheer number of malware that is created every month, so this is a potential area for AI to step in and address this problem. Cyber security companies are teaching AI systems to detect viruses and malware by using complex algorithms so AI can then run pattern recognition in software. AI systems can be trained to identify even the smallest behaviors of ransomware and malware attacks before it enters the system and then isolate them from that system. They can also use predictive functions that surpass the speed of traditional approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems that run on AI unlock potential for natural language processing which collects information automatically by combing through articles, news, and studies on cyber threats. This information can give insight into anomalies, cyber attacks, and prevention strategies. This allows cyber security firms to stay updated on the latest risks and time frames and build responsive strategies to keep organizations protected.
AI systems can also be used in situations of multi-factor authentication to provide access to their users. Different users of a company have different levels of authentication privileges which also depend on the location from which they’re accessing the data. When AI is used, the authentication framework can be a lot more dynamic and real-time and it can modify access privileges based on the network and location of the user. Multi-factor authentication collects user information to understand the behavior of this person and make a determination about the user’s access privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use AI to its fullest capabilities, it’s important that it’s implemented by the right cyber security firms who are familiar with its functioning. Whereas in the past, malware attacks could occur without leaving any indication on which weakness it exploited, AI can step in to protect the cyber security firms and their clients from attacks even when there are multiple skilled attacks occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
